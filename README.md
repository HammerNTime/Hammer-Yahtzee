# History #

Yahtzee is a dice game of chance! It was originally produced by Milton Bradley (since acquired by Hasboro) in the early 1940's; it is said that the game originated from a couple that invented it to entertain guests on their yacht, refering to it as the "yacht game". Originally marketed as Yatzie, it was rebranded to Yahtzee in 1956. Yahtzee shares many similarities to the Scandinavian game Yatzy. Hasboro claims to now sell about 50 million copies of yahtzee each year.


As a family favorite game, it felt only natural to create an on-the-go version that did not require materials or a tabletop.


# Rules #

Each turn consists of a maximum of three rolls. The first roll must be made with all five dice. If the player chooses to roll a second and, if desired, a third time, he may "hold" any or all the dice and roll again. A score must be entered after the last roll in the appropriate box or a zero entered in a box of the player’s choice. The player may also elect to enter a score in a box after either their first or second roll, at which point their turn would end and the next player would be up.

#### Upper Section ####
In the Upper Section there are boxes to score “Aces,” “Twos,” “Threes,” “Fours”, “Fives” and “Sixes.” If a player chooses to score in the Upper Section, he counts and adds only the dice with the same number and enters the total of these dice in the appropriate box.

#### BONUS ####
To earn a bonus of 35 points, a player must score 63 points or more in the Upper Section. For quick calculation, 63 may be reached by scoring 3 “Aces,” “Twos,” and so on through “Sixes,” though it may be obtained by any combination.
